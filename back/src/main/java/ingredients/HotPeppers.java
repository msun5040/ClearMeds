/**
 * A hot pepper ingredient, meant to be created when deserializing a JSON recipe.
 *
 * Using records where possible, because they provide a nice auto-definition of equals, toString, etc.
 * They are also immutable. Since they are classes, they can implement interfaces. But, since they are
 * classes that extend Record, they cannot extend other classes (since Java has no multiple inheritance).
 *
 * We'll create instances of this class via Moshi. Importantly, because Moshi deserializes into fields,
 * we won't add any extra state (i.e., we won't save the view of the soup's ingredients).
 *
 * scovilles: how hot is the pepper? in Scoville units
 * amount: how much of this pepper is being added? (See comment below)
