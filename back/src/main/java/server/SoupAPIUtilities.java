        //   (Technical note: this is what we need the 2nd Moshi dependency for; Polymorphic adapters
        //   aren't in the basic package.)

        // Now Moshi is set up to disambiguate ingredients. If we add new ingredients, we need to add them above,
        // or else come up with a cleaner way to register new ingredients without changing the code...
        //  (It's almost like that's a very common use-case in OOP. ;-))

        // One more step is needed. We can't just use an adapter like this:
        // JsonAdapter<Ingredient> ingredientAdapter = moshi.adapter(Ingredient.class).nonNull();
        // ...because we're expecting a JSON *array* of ingredients. So we need a layer that handles the enclosing list.

        // Since List is generic, we shouldn't just pass List.class to the adapter factory.
        // Instead, let's be more precise. Java has built-in classes for talking about generic types programmatically.
        // Building libraries that use them is outside the scope of this class, but we'll follow the Moshi docs'
        // template by creating a Type object corresponding to List<Ingredient>:
        Type listOfIngredientsType = Types.newParameterizedType(List.class, Ingredient.class);
        // ...and pass it instead of List.class:
        JsonAdapter<List<Ingredient>> recipeAdapter = moshi.adapter(listOfIngredientsType);
        // ...and finally read the json string:
        try {
            List<Ingredient> recipe = recipeAdapter.fromJson(jsonList);
